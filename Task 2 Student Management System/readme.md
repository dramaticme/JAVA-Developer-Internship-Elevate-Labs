# 🩶 Java Student Management System – Task 2 (August 2025)

In this task, I created a **console-based Student Management System** using Java to improve my understanding of **object-oriented programming**, **CRUD operations**, and the use of **dynamic data structures** like `ArrayList`.

This project simulates the basic functionalities of a real-world student database management tool, where users can interact through a **menu-driven interface** to add, view, update, or delete student records. I used **methods and encapsulation** to ensure clarity, modularity, and clean logic flow.

## 👾 What’s Inside?

In this project, I implemented:
- A fully interactive **menu-driven system** with 5 options:
  1. **Add Student** – Create and store a new student record
  2. **View All Students** – Display all records with details
  3. **Update Student** – Modify existing data using student ID
  4. **Delete Student** – Remove a record based on ID
  5. **Exit** – Close the program
- A **custom `Student` class** with `id`, `name`, and `marks` attributes
- Use of `ArrayList<Student>` to handle dynamic data entries
- Clear feedback to the user after every action

## 🦑 Core Features Covered

### (^▽^) Object-Oriented Programming
- Defined a `Student` class with private variables and public getters/setters
- Used constructors for initialization and `toString()` for clean display
- Encapsulation of each feature into individual methods for maintainability

### (^^ゞ Program Logic & CLI Design
- Menu-driven structure using `do-while` loop for continuous interaction
- `switch-case` for handling user selections
- Search logic using `equals()` to match student ID during update/delete
- Validation to handle empty records and invalid inputs gracefully

## 🦖 Tech Stack

| Tool / Library        | Purpose |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **Java (JDK 17)**      | Programming language |
| **VS Code / IntelliJ** | IDE used for development |
| **Terminal / Command Prompt** | Running the compiled `.class` file |
| **`ArrayList`**         | To store and manage student objects |

## 🐲 What I Learned

While building this system, I:
- Learned to design a complete **CRUD-based console application**
- Practiced using **ArrayList** to manage dynamic objects
- Understood the use of **constructors**, **getters**, and **setters**
- Used **loops and conditionals** effectively to control program flow
- Improved on writing **user-friendly interfaces** in Java
