# ðŸ‘¾ Internship Work Log â€“ Elevate Labs

Welcome to my **Internship Work Log** for **Elevate Labs**! ðŸš€  
Iâ€™ll be using this repository to **track all my tasks, projects, and learning progress** during my internship.

## ðŸ—“ Purpose

This repo will help me:
- Keep a **record of all tasks** assigned during the internship
- Document my **daily/weekly progress**
- Maintain **source code, reports, and resources** for easy reference
- Reflect on **what I learned** at each stage
